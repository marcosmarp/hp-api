# Harry Potter API

## Docs
##### [Use Swagger to test the API!](https://hp-api-marcosmarp.herokuapp.com/swagger/index.html)
### Get all characters (basic data)
Make a `GET` request to `https://hp-api-marcosmarp.herokuapp.com/api/characters`
You can filter the list through `name`, `gender`, `house`, `isWizard`, `isHogwartsStudent`, `isHogwartsStaff`, `isAlive` properties adding them to the GET query parameters
For example, `https://hp-api-marcosmarp.herokuapp.com/api/characters?name=Weasley&isAlive=true` will only return the Weasley alive characters
### Get a character by ID (detailed data)
Make a `GET` request to `https://hp-api-marcosmarp.herokuapp.com/api/characters/{id}`
For example, `https://hp-api-marcosmarp.herokuapp.com/api/characters/60be073e-2f67-416c-a87d-c9b0a8129261` will return the Harry Potter data.

## What's this?
Harry Potter API is REST API developed over .NET CORE 6 to get information about every character on the Harry Potter world.

## Where the data came from?
I blatantly stoled it from [Beth Fraser's hp-api](https://github.com/bethfraser/hp-api), there you can see who uploaded what.

## So, what's different between this API and Beth Fraser's one?
This API has a filtering and detailed-view system for retrieving the characters and the data in general; besides that, I'm open to suggestions to what can we do to improve it

## What's the stack of this project?
This project is developed on Microsoft's .NET CORE 6 framework with a PostgreSQL database hosted in heroku managed through Entity Framework. The app is currently running on a Docker container in Heroku.
